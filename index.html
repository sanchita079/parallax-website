                "Life's changes come in all shapes and sizes. For some of us a big change is simply (finally!) organizing your pantry or adding plants to the living room. 
                Others of us may be on precipice of a big career change with cross-country move or about to find out that our family of three is now going to be four. Change can be happy and exciting as well as messy and complicated.
                 And as we found out this past year, change can be painful when we lose connection with those close to us and when we find ourselves in a constant state of uncertainty."
